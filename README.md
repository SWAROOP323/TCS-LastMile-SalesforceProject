## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

A mid-sized hospital receives hundreds of appointment requests daily through phone calls, walk-ins, and its website. However, appointment scheduling is often delayed, follow-ups after consultations are missed, and patients face difficulties in tracking their medical history and doctor availability. Doctors and staff manually manage patient visits, leading to inefficiencies and poor patient experience.

To address this, the hospital wants to implement a **Salesforce CRM** to:

- Automate patient appointment booking and confirmation  
- Manage doctor schedules and availability  
- Track patient medical history and follow-up visits  
- Provide real-time dashboards for hospital administrators
